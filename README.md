# Machine-Learning
This repository contains some python code for a (regularized) multinomial logistic regression.
The code is written in Jupyter noteboooks. This work is a sample of some projects, 
my classmate who is the other author: Frank Schiro, and I did during our phD course in Machine Learning.

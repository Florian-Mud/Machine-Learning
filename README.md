# Machine-Learning
This repository contains some python code for a (regularized) multinomial logistic regression.
The code is written in Jupyter noteboooks. This work is a sample of some projects that 
 Frank Schiro -- my classmate -- and I co-authored during our phD course in Machine Learning (CS 74020) at CUNY Graduate Center, NY.
